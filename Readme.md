# **Predicting Repeat Customers for Online Retail**

## **ðŸ“Š Stakeholder**

The primary stakeholder is the **Marketing Analytics Manager** of an online retail company. The goal is to optimize promotional spending by identifying first-time customers most likely to make repeat purchases.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement**

Develop a predictive model to classify customers based on their likelihood of becoming repeat purchasers, using historical transaction data. This enables targeted retention campaigns and better allocation of marketing resources.

---

## **ðŸ“‚ Dataset**

* **Source:** [UCI Online Retail II dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail+II)

* **Records:** 525,000+ transactions over a 12-month period

* **Region Focus:** Primarily UK-based customers

---

## **ðŸ›  Feature Engineering**

* **Total Revenue:** Sum of all purchases per customer

* **Total Quantity Purchased:** Total units purchased

* **Average Price Per Item:** Mean price per product purchased

* **Recency (in days):** Days since the most recent purchase

* **Average Order Value:** Total revenue divided by the number of unique invoices

* **Invoice Frequency:** Number of unique invoices (used to label repeat customers)

---

## **ðŸ¤– Models Used**

### **âœ… Random Forest Classifier**

* Hyperparameters tuned:

  * `n_estimators`

  * `max_depth`

  * `min_samples_split`

### **âœ… Logistic Regression**

* Hyperparameters tuned:

  * `C`

  * `solver`

  * `max_iter`

---

## **ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics**

The following metrics were used to evaluate model performance, focusing on both accuracy and business applicability:

* **Precision**

* **Recall**

* **F1 Score**

* **ROC-AUC**

---

## **ðŸš€ Future Work**

* Incorporate additional customer demographics and behavioral data

* Experiment with advanced models like **XGBoost** and **Neural Networks**

* Deploy the model via an API for real-time scoring and integration into marketing systems

* Add automated monitoring and retraining pipelines
